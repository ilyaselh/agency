Legal translation is considered by many translators to be the hardest and most challenging types of translation specialties, mostly because of the high complexity of the documents and the attention to detail that it demands. When you include Arabic in the mix, it becomes even more challenging. Law offices, government entities, and private companies all require legal translation services on a regular basis.

Legal translation demands extreme accuracy in the final product, just one mistake would set you back for weeks, or in some extreme cases, it can even get you in legal trouble. It is important that you trust your legal translation project or documents to a translator that is specialized in the legal field, preferably a certified translator would be your best choice.

Now let's dive into answering some pressing questions:

## What Is Legal Translation?

As the name implies, a legal translation is a translation that is used in a legal context for legal purposes. Legal translation could include translating legal documents, like contracts, patents, etc... 

Legal translations should only be handled by translators who are specialized in the legal field. Usually these translators are educated in legal matters, and they have adequate knowledge about the law in both the source and the target languages' countries.

A respectable translation agency should have a rigorous process of choosing its legal translators, since trying to cheap out in this matter will only cause more trouble than it's worth in the long term. Preferably hiring certified translators is your best choice, since they have already been screened by the legal entity that certified them.

## The Importance of Accurate Legal Translation

Most people who are not involved in the translation industry don't realize how important a legal translation is. It is important to understand what part a legal translator plays in legal proceedings and why it is necessary to use them.

Legal documents are very complex and often need to be translated from one language into another in order for them to be understood by someone who speaks a different language than the one the document was originally written in. There are many types of legal documents that require some sort of translation before they can be used properly. These documents include:

* Wills
* Marriage certificates
* Divorce papers
* Contracts
* Birth certificates
* Patents
* etc...

Legal Translators make sure that these documents follow the legal terms so that they will be recognized as legitimate in whatever court they are being presented in. Without the correct translation, these documents could be seen as invalid or fraudulent which would some major inconvenience for anyone involved including judges, lawyers and any other person who is involved.

## Aspects of Great Legal Translation Services

### The Translator

Translation in its core is a job that requires an in-depth knowledge and expertise of the project's field, as well as the specific terminology that is used in that field. The translator needs to understand not only the source language and the target language but also the subject matter. Whether it's law or medicine or any other field, anyone offering translation services must be familiar with their subject. He or she must be able to answer any questions that arise during the translation process.

A professional legal translation service should include a translator who has years of experience translating documents in the legal field. They should be familiar with legal terminology, and they should have legal training before working on legal documents. A lot of legal translators worked as paralegals in their previous job, some even were lawyers themselves.

Legal translators often consult specialized bilingual [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_dictionary "Law dictionary")legal dictionaries, or as they are know in the translation industry as glossaries. Caution should be exercised, as some law dictionaries are of very poor quality and their use may lead to mistranslation.

It goes beyond being said, but a professional translator will respect the deadlines and understand that if a deadline is missed, there can be serious consequences for both parties.

### The Formatting

In most countries, legal documents need to be in a specific format. Not only does each section have an order and title but it also has a specific font and paragraph style that makes it clear that the document is without doubt a legal document. 

Legal translation is a lot different than other forms of translation because it often deals with formatting as much as it deals with the actual meaning of the words that are being translated. Because of this there are translation tools available that can help you with formatting your legal documents so they fit all the rules and regulations.

One way that you can find out more about the format is to look at example documents online. This will allow you to see how each section is supposed to look so that you know whether or not your translations will be acceptable for legal purposes.
