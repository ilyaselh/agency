It is pretty challenging to translate text from one language to another in a such a manner that the translated text retains the same meaning, style, and tone. Sometimes, you can keep the meaning with some changes in the tone; however, more often than not it is not that simple. This is exactly the case with **Arabic to English Translation.**

Language is not just about words; it is not just a couple of letters strung together to make sense. Language is about the emotion that the words invoke in the reader; it is about the tone; about the interpretation. That’s why translation is not easy, because you are not just translating the words according to the dictionary. The translation is correct only when the translated text can invoke the same emotions as the original.

Literature is the best example. When working on translating a book for example ,professional Arabic translators will think first of convening the meaning and emotions of the original text, and they will mostly disregard the wording that the original used.

## Challenges in A**rabic to English Translation**

Arabic is one of the most commonly spoken languages in the world, with approximately 300 million native speakers spread across the globe. Arabic is the fifth most widely spoken language in the world, just behind English, French, and Mandarin. Almost 22 countries in North Africa and the Middle East use Arabic as their primary language.

Despite its popularity, Arabic, like Mandarin, comes with it's own set of challenges and difficulties, which makes it one of the most difficult languages to translate. Arabic is a Semitic language so it is largely different from English and other languages of the West. This is why a highly skilled translator is required to effectively **translate Arabic to English**.

Here are some of the challenges that Arabic to English translation faces:

### Dialects

A unique aspect of Arabic that the western world doesn't have is that each country that speaks Arabic has developed its own dialect over many centuries, derived from the classical Arabic roots. This means that two people from different nations speaking Arabic might have great difficulty in understanding each other, for example the Moroccan dialect and the Saudi dialect are completely different from each other. This makes translation rather difficult. Someone could be fluent in Arabic, but it is highly likely that they would only be fluent in one or two dialect at most.

### Culture

The main focus of translation is to ensure that everyone can experience different cultures and famous literary works. For Arabic people, this is a pretty difficult.

Sometimes one English word can not completely replace an Arabic one. The linguist is required to use one or more entire sentences in English to accurately explain a single Arabic word.

For example, ‘Hor Al-Ayn’ is not a word, rather an Islamic concept in which ‘Hor’ means ‘intense whiteness and deep blackness of the eyes’ and ‘Al-Ayn’ means ‘eyes’. The whole term refers to a beautiful woman who will be a reward for doing good deeds in life. This is an excellent example of how one Arabic word requires one whole sentence in English to accurately convey its meaning.

### Grammar

When a text is translated, it should come across as natural. The problem is that the sentence structure and grammar of the Arabic language is completely different from that of English or any other Western language. This means that even though an amateur Arabic translator might translate an English sentence word for word, it still would come of as unnatural to a native English speaker.

For example, in English, you would say ‘many years ago’, but an amateur Arabic translator speaker who does not have experience speaking English would translate it as ‘since many years ago’, according to their own sentence structure.

### Letters

The Arabic alphabet has 28 letters, that means two more letters than the English alphabet. There are some Arabic letters that have no English equivalent. In fact, some Arabic letters have special tones that are not found in any other language, which is why it takes foreign Arabic learners a least a year to accurately speak certain letters such as "Ein - ع" and "Khayn - خ".

### Thinking Methods

Most Arabic translator face this challenge. When translating from English to Arabic, they have to switch their thinking method from the English way of thinking to the Arabic way.

Phrasal verbs are the perfect way to explain this. In English, the sentence ‘I think of/about something/someone/’ would translate to ‘I think in something’ or ‘I think by someone’. The use of prepositions in the two languages is very different, as is shown in the above example.
