Entering a market with different language requirements necessitates a well-developed SEO strategy designed to fully exploit market opportunities.\
\
A 2014 study by the Common Sense Advisory, 85.3-percent of respondents the availability of pre-purchase information in their own language as a critical factor when it comes to buying items or services.\
\
Regardless of if you call it multilingual search engine optimization, or geolocational targeting, mindful SEO localization can alter both site structure and design. Please see our 10 web localization SEO tips on how to maximize the results of your localization project:

### 1. Don’t Equate Localization TO Translation

While similar, it’s a mistake to think of the as equals. Straight translation of your text typically brings a lower ROI than a translated, and localized, version of your web content.\
\
To make your content truly attractive to non-English speakers, you’ll need to bring an SEO expert on board that can make your new content attractive to both potential clients and foreign search engines.

### 2. Do Your Keyword Diligence

Create a keyword list for all the pages you’d like to translate and have them translated separately. When that’s done, ask an SEO expert to localize the list for you.\
\
The result will be a highly-targeted version of your keyword list that will perform exceptionally well in your given market. Once you have the list, you can optimize to your heart’s content.

### 3. Kepp Your Website Structure And Content In Mind

Be careful in selecting pages you wish to translate. Some of your content may be outdated and inappropriate for a successful localization strategy.\
\
Additionally, to avoid duplication issues with search engines, avoid copying original language pages to the local website; use links or redirects instead.

### 4. Create A Global Glossary

Create a global glossary for your keywords and specific terminology. Share this document with all of your offices, and stakeholders, so that appropriate, language-specific versions of these words can be found.

### 5. Don't Forget All Your Website Elements

While some website elements may be hidden from visitors, such as META and TITLE tags), it’s important to also adjust these items to local requirements.\
\
You should also take the time to consider whether you wish to localize your URLs, or create a sub-domain of your original website. Many companies choose to indicate language changes in the URLs text.

### 6. Be Smart About Your Language Markers

The best way to show language choices on your site is a simple, localized dropdown. Using flags, as some companies might, can result in confusion for polylingual nations.\
\
Detecting the browser’s language, and automatically selecting a localized version of your site, presents its own pitfalls. Regardless of your chosen method, make it simple to choose and switch between languages.

### 7. Don't Forget The Complementary Content

Localize everything you can; this includes your applications, data feeds, and social media content. Also, be sure to register for all local directories and services.

### 8. Remember Your Sitemap

Update your sitemap to include the localized version. Consider creating a new, local version for anything being run locally. You should also consider creating a new footer to hold links to all your international websites.\
