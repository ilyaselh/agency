        <p>Medical translation by definition is the translation of documents and papers regarding pharmaceuticals and all the parts that make up the healthcare industry. The medical sector has a huge amount of responsibility towards its customers. A large amount of the content the industry generates is sensitive documentation that must be reviewed exhaustively in order to avoid any errors. Even preparing all the documentation the sector generates in the Arabic language is difficult, so translating it into other languages is a process that goes beyond a word by word translation. The meaning of the source text must be preserved, and equivalents need to be found for the complex terminology the sector uses.</p>
<h2>Why translation is so important in the medical sector.</h2>
<p>In the field of medicine, progress is constantly being made. Every day new pharmaceutical products or medical devices are released and this information needs to be available internationally. In this case, medical translation plays a crucial role, as most countries around the world require all documentation and labelling of medical devices or pharmaceutical products to be translated into the official national language before it can be presented to the public. Thanks to medical translation, most of the medicines found in pharmacies have translated content so that patients can perfectly understand the information.</p>
<p>The sector has a vast number of specialist areas and disciplines. When we talk about medicine we're not just referring to a single field, but a wide range of specialist areas and disciplines which are all related. Some of the main areas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biochemistry</li>
<li>Dermatology</li>
<li>Ophthalmology</li>
<li>Genetics</li>
<li>Dentistry</li>
<li>Psychiatry</li>
<li>Virology</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
Looking at all these diverse sectors in the medical industry, it's clear that the scope of the term &quot;medical&quot; is vast. So when it comes to translating materials from any of these different branches of medicine, it's important to put the translation in the hands of native professional translators who specializes in medicine, with experience in the particular area you're dealing with.</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>A translator who works on a medical translation for the first time needs to grapple with specialist medical terminology. Although an exhaustive approach to research can help, if the translator doesn't specialize in the field they will come across issues of equivalence, interpretation, and use that vary across languages. It's also very easy to succumb to so-called &quot;false friends&quot; that are common between various languages, for example between Spanish and English.</p>
<p>A professional translator who specializes in medical translation will have the right experience to give them the skills to adapt the translation to the end purpose of the translation (professional field, area of training, disclosure, generalist, etc.) both linguistically and culturally.</p>
<h2>What is medical translation useful for?</h2>
<p>When we talk about medical translation, it is very important to be meticulous with the terminology, as even a small error can cause confusion and possibly even lead to serious consequences for the patient. For this reason, it is essential that the translator has complete mastery over the medical and technical language used in this type of text.</p>
<p>As we have seen, medical translation encompasses a wide range of disciplines such as pharmacy, dermatology, dentistry, physiology, genetics, and ophthalmology. Among all the content we translate at EA Translations, here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Medical records
Medical supplies
Reports for insurance
Medical reports
Medical files
Clinical tests
Scientific publications
Scientific research
Academic papers</p>
<p>As you can see there's a huge variety of documents that may need to be translated. And it's important that all these different types of translations are entrusted to professional specialist translators.</p>
<h2>Who Can Handle Arabic Medical Translation?</h2>
<p>The short answer would definitely be a medical translator. You cannot take the risk of hiring an general translator who has never worked on a medical project before. That's because unlike general translations, mistakes in medical translations can cause severe accidents, and in some very extreme cases, they could cost someone's life. Therefore it is absolutely crucial to hire a professional medical translator instead of risking it and hiring a amateur, no matter how attractive their pricing might be.</p>
<h2>How Much Does an Arabic Medical Translation Cost?</h2>
<p>The cost of medical translation is just any other field in this case, it depends on two major factors:</p>
<h3>The Deadline</h3>
<p>A shorter deadline time for medical translation services usually means greater costs, it known as a rush fee delivery. For specific pricing information on your medical documents, don't hesitate to <a href="https://englisharabictranslations.com/#Contact">request a free quote.</a> Don't forget to include your document word count, the language pair, and of course, the deadline.</p>
